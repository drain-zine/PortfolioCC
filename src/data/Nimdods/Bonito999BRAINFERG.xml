    1 am sunday night terrible rattling on the doorknob scared of being real scared; 
    i think i see a face in my neighbor’s tree. 
    “curled something” i tell my friends and then all i can do is laugh too;
    spinning-thin space-autumn-cicada-bush warble-living laughing loving-hahahaha-stump; 
    believing in ghosts again; ymca smell hauntology—face in the shower-granite,-real heavy—hate it, knife under the bed just in case—
    long rattling, long durée, slow pause, slow heaviness, around the corner, through the side gate, into the patio, next to the door, next to me, hopefully not next to me—terrible rattling, real scared, scared

    # MAY 14, 2021 - THOUGHTS ON KORN
  </textbox>
  
  <textbox>
For some inexplicable reason, I've felt a strong draw to the band Korn recently. Constantly, [Freak on a Leash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRGrNDV2mKc) plays through my head, I saw the artist Lil Texas with a Korn tattoo earlier today (see below), and earlier this week, I even felt inclined to purchase a (relatively) [vintage Korn t-shirt](https://www.depop.com/products/allifisher1-rare-vintage-korn-issues-album/).

    The tattoo in question

      What can I make of all this though? I never was particularly keen on Korn when younger, and I (thanks to a fellow [bossman](https://www.tm-stnt.dev/)) only really picked up on things perhaps comparable (thinking especially of Limp Bizkit and [this track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v290M8W-HFI), which kind of blows my mind) in the last year.

 Is this an expression of some inner angst that I've been unknowingly carrying for a long time? Perhaps! Is it a connection to my recent fascination with XXL sized t-shirts, giving me a Durstian fitment that puts me onto some strong CEO vibes? Partially, yes!

       But more so than anything else, I think it is a reflection on the idea of new sincerity that re-entered my life, following the same earlier bossman keeping me updated with his reading of *Infinite Jest*, something which I only *barely* remember since reading it almost 5-6 years ago now, under the impression it was an unspoken required reading for being a college English Lit major.

        <col>
        There's something that I find so sincere about the act of listening to Korn itself, something that perhaps translates the feelings of transcendence I felt upon discovering [Alex G's *Race*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IZCY7lhs2M) last January, for example, into the quotidian. I hate to say it, as it sounds corny, but there's a reliable rawness that permeates their music that makes me just want to drink Monsters and thrash in my room. But that's all I have to say right now.

     The track of the week is [Tony Tribe's rendition of "Red Red Wine"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNgzk0TvJJI).

      The garment of the week is this [Yohji Yamamoto SS14 Object Dyed T-Shirt](https://www.grailed.com/listings/21889159-yohji-yamamoto-rare-yohji-yamamoto-eat-my-fingers-object-dyed-t-shirt), which I am regrettably the new owner of.
