# **THEORY:** 
American poet Kay Ryan notes the curiosity of scale, stating that by “changing size... [we] loosen an imaginative space that gets larger as it gets smaller” (“On the Miniature”). “mushroomhead” draws upon Ryan’s thinking and applies it to the question of spatial representation. Essentially, if a physically tangible asset is brought into a new, digital environment, what happens to it?

# **THEORY (CONT.)**
This artwork seeks to answer this question by embracing naturally occurring fungus (and other small objects), with its comparably diminutive size in everyday life, and highlighting its ability to draw attention and get “larger as it gets smaller” when compressed into an expansive virtual space.
