# **PROCESS:**
Accepted presented structure by [Prada](https://www.prada.com/us/en/pradasphere/special-projects/2020/acronyms.html); ideated; wrote accordingly

# **THEORY:**
“Art feeds on restrictions, or rather perhaps it would be truer to say that they are the very ground on which it grows, the earth from which it reaches up towards its imagined heaven.”

# **THEORY (CONT.)**
Daryush's understanding of "restrictions" reveal an inherent fluidity within textual space. If form is an infrastructure for thought, form, by that very quality, imagines external space — the world outside — and allows its translator (the poet) to communicate it appropriately. Can poetry function as a tool for unity?
