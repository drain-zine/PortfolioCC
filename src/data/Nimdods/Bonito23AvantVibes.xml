# MANIFESTO
[Avant Vibes](http://drainzine.fr/AVANT_VIBES/) (AV) is a simultaneously a rejection and an embrace of contemporary culture. Postmodernism (and what lags ahead of it) has distilled the everyday into objects of irony, facetiously presented as the sincere. AV embraces the keyword (or "vibe") as a representative form to resist this immediate turn within cultural discourse, transforming it into the proverbial seed for a network for relationality.

# MANIFESTO (CONT.)
AV inhabits the beginning and middle of space, not the end. AV is a point of departure, wherever that may be. AV is genuinely fascinated with what it discusses. AV is an entity that promotes discourse, not stifle it. AV is an experiment in rebuilding connection through the linkage of objects, loosely speaking. Through the media of internet radio, AV translates the real into the real. AV is the compression of time into the long-reaching "now".

AV values all mediums of expression and experience. Episodes were crafted with specific visuals and advertisements in mind.
