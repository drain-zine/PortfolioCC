	<div class="contentBody mtn-6 ml-25 mb-5">Derrida was born on July 15, 1930, in a summer home in El Biar (Algiers), Algeria,[2] into a Sephardic Jewish family (originally from Toledo) that became French in 1870 when the Crémieux Decree granted full French citizenship to the Arabic-speaking Mizrahi Jews of Algeria.[22] His parents, Haïm Aaron Prosper Charles (Aimé) Derrida (1896–1970)[23] and Georgette Sultana Esther Safar (1901–1991),[24][25][26] named him "Jackie", "which they considered to be an American name", though he would later adopt a more "correct" version of his first name when he moved to Paris; some reports indicate that he was named Jackie after the American child actor Jackie Coogan, who had become well-known around the world via his role in the 1921 Charlie Chaplin film The Kid.[27][28][29] He was also given the middle name Élie after his paternal uncle Eugène Eliahou, at his circumcision; this name was not recorded on his birth certificate unlike those of his siblings, and he would later call it his "hidden name".[30]

Derrida was the third of five children. His elder brother Paul Moïse died at less than three months old, the year before Derrida was born, leading him to suspect throughout his life his role as a replacement for his deceased brother.[27] Derrida spent his youth in Algiers and in El-Biar.
